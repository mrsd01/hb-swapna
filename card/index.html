          Dear Swapna,
          <br />
          Wishing you a very Happy Birthday!!!!
          <br /><br />On this special day, I want to take a moment to celebrate you and the incredible friendship we've
          shared over the years.<br /><br />

          From the days of high school, when we first met in 7th grade, to becoming close in 8th grade with Pallabi as
          part of our trio, you've always been a significant part of my life. You were the prettiest girl in school, and
          although I was too shy to talk much initially, our bond grew stronger and more meaningful over
          time.<br /><br />

          Looking back, I realize there were times when I didn't communicate as I should have, especially during those
          challenging years in classes 11 and 12. I regret the distance that grew between us then. Yet, despite
          everything, you have always been so understanding and kind, never complaining about anything. <br /><br />

          It's been almost three years since we last met, but I still remember the moment when you reached out to me
          during my lowest phase in my second year of college. Your message and unwavering support were exactly what I
          needed. I am forever grateful to have a friend like you, who stands by me through thick and thin.<br /><br />

          Now, as we celebrate your birthday, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being there for me.
          You are an amazing friend, and I cherish our friendship deeply. While our story didn't turn out as a love
          story, my love for you as a best friend is unending. I promise to always be there for you, to protect you, and
          to support you in every way I can. <br /><br />

          I hope we can meet soon and create even more wonderful memories together. May your birthday be filled with
          joy, laughter, and everything your heart desires.<br /><br />

          With all my love and gratitude,
          <br />
          <br />Sujoy
